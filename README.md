Hero Squad
By Joshua Musau
Description

Hero Squad is a project that allows users who interact with it to create heroes and squads that contain a particular number of heroes . Heroes can be affiliated with only 1 squad at a single time, therefore if the hero was to switch to another group, their name should not be present in the previous squad that they were in
